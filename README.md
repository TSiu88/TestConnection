# TestConnection

### Test with connecting to SQL Server using ASP.NET - 6.25.2020

By Tiffany Siu

## About

This is a simple, web application that builds on a premade default page to create a connection with a SQL Server.  This will query the server to use stored procedures and return results into an ASP.NET gridview.

The SQL Connection has been modified for privacy and needs to be in the same network as the server so this application will not work, it is just a reference for syntax.

## Known Bugs

No known bugs at this time.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Framework
- Markdown
- ASP.NET
- SQL Server

## Instructions
This program will not work without correct passwords and SQL connection.  These have been removed for privacy so they will need to be added for this program to work.

1. Edit web.config file to have valid SQL connection to a database
2. Run this program with the `Default.aspx` file as the main file
3. View application in Web browser
